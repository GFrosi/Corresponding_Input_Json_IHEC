# Corresponding_Input_Json_IHEC
Scripts to maniputate IP and Inputs information extracted from GEO, and to generate json files for each IP samples from a big json 


# Requirements

```python 3``` and ```install requirements.txt in your env```

- extract-srr-GSE.py

```
usage: extract-srr-GSE.py file.csv (i.e gse_histones_no_diff.csv) 

The csv file should contains the 'GSE' and 'SRR' columns.
This script will generate directories in your current path with the name of each series. In addition, it will generate in each directory a txt file containing a list of the SRR for each sample associated with that specific GSE.

```

- extract-srr-cctrl.py


```
usage: extract-srr-GSE.py file1.csv file2.csv (gse_histones_no_diff.csv; gse_histones_complete.csv) 

The csv files should contains the 'GSE', 'SRR' and 'Corresponding_inputs' columns (generated by word_dist.py script)

This script will check if all GSE directories already exist. Otherwise, it will generate the respective directory (i.e GSE1234). For each GSE dir, this script will write txt files containing the SRR related with each corresponding input for each IP.

```


- srr_data_struct.py
